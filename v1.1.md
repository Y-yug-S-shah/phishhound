### 🚀 What's New in v1.1

This release significantly upgrades PhishHound’s usability, detection clarity, and compatibility for blue team analysts and SOC automation.

#### ✅ New Features
- **`.eml` File Support**  
  Now accepts RFC-822 formatted `.eml` email files in addition to `.txt` headers.

- **`--explain` Flag**  
  Shows detailed reasoning behind each risk score or detection rule triggered.

- **Export to File**
  - `--export-json`: Saves analysis output as structured JSON.
  - `--export-txt`: Saves report in analyst-readable plain text.
  - Both outputs stored in `/phishhound/reports/`.

- **`--manual` Flag**  
  Custom usage guide replacing `--help`, ideal for CLI users.

#### 🔧 Enhancements
- Improved `argparse` logic (no path required for flags)
- Better header field alignment
- Clean CLI design and banner centering

> 🧪 Tested on `.eml` phishing samples with spoofed headers, DKIM/SPF fails, and malformed return paths.
